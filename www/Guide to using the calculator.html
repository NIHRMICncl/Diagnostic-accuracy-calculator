        This is quite straightforward, <i><b>provided</b></i> you

        The tab "Guide to using the results of the calculator" explains
        why data from a cohort study cannot be used to calculate
        predictive values or prevalence.<br>
        It also explains why <b>positive and negative predictive values
          vary with prevalence</b>.<b><font color="seagreen"><br>

    <h3><b><font color="#996633">Using the calculator for cohort studies</font></b></h3>
    <p>Using the calculator to compute diagnostic accuracy measures is
      straightforward when TP, FP, FN, and TN are available from a
      cohort study.</p>
    <p>If the data available from a cohort study includes sensitivity
      and specificity, and you wish to compute TP, FP, FN, and TN (and
      positive and negative predictive values) you will also have to
      enter the prevalence of the condition in the target population,
      and the number of samples in the study. <br>
      <br>
      This is a constraint of "simple" algebra: TP, FP, FN, and TN are 4
      independent variables, so their computation requires 4 different
      independent data items. <br>
      <br>
      With this knowledge, it should be straightforward to use the
      calculator.<br>
      <br>

    <h3><b><font color="#996633">Using the calculator for case-control
          studies</font></b> </h3>
    <p>If the data available from a case-control study includes
      sensitivity and specificity, the calculator can be used to
      essentially reverse engineer the TP, FP, FN, TN counts that would
      have been found by a cohort study. However, the prevalence
      (pre-test probability) and number of samples must be provided as
      well as sensitivity and specificity. This allows the positive and
      negative predictive values to also be computed.<br>
    </p>
    If the data available from a case-control study includes TP, FP, FN,
    and TN, you will also need to enter the prevalence and study size to
    enable the calculation of predictive values. <br>
    (This contrasts with a cohort study design, which allows the study
    size, prevalence and predictive values to be calculated from TP, FP,
    FN, and TN.)<br>
    <br>
    The calculator essentially reverse engineers the TP, FP, FN, and TN
    counts that would be found in a cohort study with the same
    sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and number of samples in the
    study.<br>
    You can see the reverse engineered TP, FP, FN, and TN counts in the
    2x2 table. They will be different from the TP, FP, FN, and TN counts
    that you entered.<br>
    <br>
    Of course, you can misuse the calculator by pretending that a
    case-control study was actually a cohort study, but then you would
    be given incorrect positive and negative predictive values. And, if
    you were to look at the calculated prevalence you would see that it
    is highly unlikely to reflect any real clinical population. Do not
    do this and then use the results to inform real clinical decisions!<br>
