    To fully understand this, it might be helpful to work through an
    example taken from a typical evaluation of a new diagnostic test.<br>
    <p>The Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test measures antibodies to the
      coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and Public Health England has
      published their evaluation of the test[4].<br>
      The results of Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 testing were compared in
      case-control studies with results from PCR testing for the virus's
      RNA.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The report discusses in full detail the implications of
      evaluating a new test for having had an infection against a test
      for having an active infection. The analyses took appropriate
      account of the fact that antibodies can take several weeks to
      become apparent after an infection, and that viral RNA becomes
      detectable a few day after infection.<br>
    </p>
    <p>For our example, we will select one subgroup: patients who were
      tested 7 to 13 days after their positive PCR test. The report
      provides the TP, FP, FN, and TN data, and gives predictive values
      for a prevalence of 10%. However, we would also like to know what
      the predictive values are at prevalence that might be found in
      potential populations for screening, say from 2% to 40%.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Our steps in using the calculator are:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Enter titles for the tables and graphs: Roche Elecsys
        Anti-SARS-CoV-2 test 7-13 days post PCR confirmation.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Tick the "case-control/don't know" and "TP, FP, FN, TN" boxes.
        <br>
        The calculator will then require you to enter TP, FP, FN, and
        TN. It will also require the study size and prevalence.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Enter 52, 10, 7, 5262 for TP, FP, FN, and TN, and 1000 for
        study size (to enable calculation of confidence intervals) and
        10 for the prevalence as a percentage.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Select the option to show confidence intervals.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Click on Recalculate "(will take a while)"<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Note the 2x2 contingency matrix. <br>
        This shows the TP, FP, FN, and TN "reverse engineered" to
        reflect the cohort study that would have found the same
        sensitivity and specificity. This is a different set of TP, FP,
        FN, and TN that were entered.<br>
        This data allows predictive values to be computed and graphed to
        show their dependence on prevalence.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Note the graph of predictive values against prevalence.<br>
        The prevalence that was entered is shown as a vertical line with
        labels displaying the positive and negative predictive values at
        that prevalence, which is 10% in our example.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Note the horizontal bar of action buttons that appears when
        you move the cursor over the graph.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Note that the two predictive values are quite close, and this
        causes the labels to overlap.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Click on the little zoom + button, and then click and hold
        while you outline a rectangle around the predictive values.<br>
        Magically the graph will zoom in so you can see the labels
        separately.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
